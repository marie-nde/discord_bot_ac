# discord_bot_ac
A Discord bot for Animal Crossing players.

Features :
- Creation of a unique passport for each user with their pseudo in-game, isle, fruit, friend code and a short biography.
- Creation of a "dodocode" card, with the dodocode of the user and the reason.
- Possibility to see all the active dodocodes.
- Possibility to see the friend codes of other users.
- Creation of a waiting list with 10 users maximum.
- Possibility to see and update the waiting list of anyone. Each time it mentions the next user.
- Possibility to reset every data (passport, dodocode, waiting list).
- A random game with cards.
- A hidden command which can only be used by me.
- Creation of a wishlist with several items.
- Creation of a list of crafts.

In coming :
- A help command
- Refund of all the command names

I'll add a wiki of every command once the bot is finished.
